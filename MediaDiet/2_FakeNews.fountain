**Fake News**

It sucks that fake news exists.

But we can be thankful that it probably isn’t as widespread as you think. 

Because there is lots of bad news that isn’t fake, just sensational.

Fake news is news that is actually false. 

Information that has absolutely no basis in reality, a fiction.

Journalism is far from perfect, but there are a tonne of ways to bend the truth without breaking it.

Fake news is a serious allegation. 

We need a more nuanced approach to criticizing media.
