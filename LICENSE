* Note to (copyright lawyer) collaborator:

1.
The "content" should not include derived works, such as video content that uses the script; because that could harm monetization.

Our understanding is that derived works, not stored in the repository, are copyright protected because they require substantial additional work to produce. Is this true?

2.
If we create video content that uses the same scripts, and is not stored in the repository, does that constitute a "substantial portion of the Content"?
