Evidence-based belief can take many forms. Like scientific, political, or religious. These have a common feature. 

They make a best effort to determine their belief using evidence, instead of their prior beliefs *(A: Link to “Confirmation Bias” at end)*.

Now prior beliefs have a habit of slipping in, when humans are doing the decision-making, nobody is perfect. That’s why we said best effort. It’s about whether being evidence-based is your intention, more than it’s about skill.
